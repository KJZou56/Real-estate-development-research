A small, private housing organization is looking to expand on opportunities in new 
neighborhoods. Although the organization cannot disclose much about their project, they would 
still like an outside opinion on housing market patterns in certain neighborhoods. 
The organization has hired you as a consultant to analyze a subset of their data and provide 
recommendations for areas of potential growth. The organization has a mix of people with 
varying data science backgrounds. The ones who will be reading your report range from 
somewhat familiar with data science to completely unfamiliar with data science. They have 
asked you to make sure that your report is clear to all readers. The organization would also like 
an annotated copy of your R-code in case they need to re-run analyses. 

Generate a data report and summary of the given dataset. 

Data, instruction and a report are included in the repository.
